# DVD-Store-Management-App
This is a project i did in my second year of software development, i was required to make an application for store managemnet and i chose a dvd store

This project was done in 3 stages with each stage adding more features but also overwriting older features like a save system being replaced with a DB system, this creates useless code in the app from previous stages

The app is designed to be used by a cashier at a desk of a a DVD rental store
